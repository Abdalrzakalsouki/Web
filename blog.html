<h1 id = "h3"> The Impossible Dream (Novel) </h1>
<p>With the arrival of the frost, which began with a dense snowfall, seeming on the windows as if it was a thick curtain that conceals the sight. And with lanterns hanging from the ceilings in all homes, the ten year old “Takuyami Akyu” bursts into tears, weeping
“mommy… mommy… mommy…”.

It was a sad funeral, besides the passing away of the mother “Takuyami Kia”, the crowd was depressed.
The father “Takuyami Kadashi”, the brother “Takuyami Dean”
And some acquaintances of the family.

After the service had ended and they went back home, “Akyu” layed on his bed and covered his head with the sheets, with the ever lasting memories of his mother on his mind, the tears had drowned his cheeks“He had drowned in tears”.

As soon as he started reminiscing, he fell asleep
He was tired… exhausted… lonely…

He will never part the memory of the 6th of February, the memory of the snowfall and the frost, The date of his mother’s passing, who had left behind her a small family.

She has been ill for years, the doctors were confused by her illness, but they have had hinted that it might be of a psychological nature.

“Akyu” started having that dream as soon as he fell asleep

“Akyu” was chasing that girl, though he did not know for what reason

Perhaps it was because he couldn’t find anybody else in that frightening weather!!

“Akyu” was stumbled when his brother “Dean” woke him up.

“Akyu” He felt relieved when he realized that it was just a dream.

“Akyu’s” brother “Dean” woke him up because he didn’t wish for his brother to be late for his first day in school, even though it has been less than a week since the Their mother “Takuyami Kia” had passed away. “Akyu” of-course did not want to go because of his grief for his mother. When his brother realized that, he closed his eyes in sorrow and told “Akyu” the he shouldn’t be late because mother is watching.

Suddenly, “Akyu” bursts into somewhat of a doubtful joy regarding what his brother had told him, but that doubt quickly faded away as soon as his brother reassured him.

“Dean” told “Akyu” to dress up quickly.

In effort to keep a positive attitude, “Akyu” kept chanting in a low voice and overwhelming joy

“mommy… mommy’s watching… mommy’s alive…”.
